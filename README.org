*** problem

    the UMKC CSEE department needs help automating the scheduling of professors and courses that
    need teaching for a given semester given the constraints of professorial staff, conflicts
    between sequencing and order that classes should be taught, and other minutia involved with
    class scheduling.

    the full project prompt can be found [[file:docs/alternative_capstone_project_prompt.docx][here]].

    [[https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/detail/557.png]]

    =dwebble= is a Rust based application that uses the [[https://rocket.rs/][Rocket]] web framework. It is still under heavy
    development and is liable to massive changes!

** project setup

*** install rust

    preferably, using [[https://rustup.rs/][rustup]]. if you are running an unix like environment, the following cli command
    will get you started:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    #+END_SRC

    for 64bit windows, download the installer [[https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64][here]].

*** running the project

    after installing rust, simply run:

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd dwebble/
    cargo run --release
    #+END_SRC

    the application will be running and waiting for you at [[http://localhost:8000/]].
