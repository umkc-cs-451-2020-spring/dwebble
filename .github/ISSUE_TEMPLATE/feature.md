<!-- New feature proposal template. Taken from: https://github.com/opensecuritycontroller/community/blob/master/new-features/new-feature-template.md -->

# <!-- FEATURE NAME HERE -->
<!-- Provide a short single paragraph description for the feature. -->
<!-- Example:
Stabilize the Rust to JS API to integrate the front-end and back-end of the application.

-->


## Assignees
<!-- Provide the names and GitHub handles of the contributors driving the implementation of this feature. -->

## Background
<!-- Provide any additional background for the feature. I.e.: user scenarios, business value, etc. -->
<!-- Example:

In order for the front-end to both *initiate* and communicate *back* to the rust module export, the Rust module needs to have a means to translate the following native game types to their JS equivalents:

  - [ ] `Board`
  - [ ] `GameState`
  
-->



## Constraints and Assumptions
<!-- Call out any constraint and/or assumption relevant for the development and use of this feature. -->

<!-- Example:

- The rust module has `GameState`, but meeting minutes and the generated design outlines have this as `BoardState`. Which is it?
-->

## Blockers
<!-- List existing issues/features that pose as potential blockers to implementing this feature -->
<!-- Example:

- there is a great chance #23 will add to the criteria required by this issue, but there isn't much else to say until that time comes.

-->

## Design Changes
<!-- List any minor or breaking changes that will be required on the relevant software component. If this issue requires changes to more than just one component, create more than one feature issue to document this -->

## References
<!-- List any relevant references for feature implementation, i.e. Library documentation, example code, technical resources that influence a design choice, etc -->
